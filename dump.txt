Syllabus: Week 1: Strategy Strategy is the long-term direction and scope of an organization as that organization pursues advantage through its configuration of resources to meet the needs of markets and to fulfill stakeholder expectations (Johnson and Scholes 2006). Corporate strategy addresses which business a corporation will participate in and business strategy focuses on how a particular business competes within its industry. Week 2: Entrepreneurship Shane and Venkataraman (2000 p. 218) define the academic field of entrepreneurship as the “scholarly examination of how by whom and with what effects opportunities to create future goods and services are discovered evaluated and exploited.” Why do some people and not others discover and exploit the opportunities that are the heart of entrepreneurship Week 3: Leadership Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal. We look at competing views of what leaders should do what they actually do how leaders establish organizational culture and what are the elements of constructive leadership. Week 4: Organization and Processes Organizational design is the alignment of structure process rewards metrics and talent with the strategy of the business. In this chapter we describe what has (and has not) been established to promote organizational effectiveness. Week 5: International Business All companies—even new companies in new industries—must consider the global environment in which they operate. Key international business literature addresses dimensions such as theories of multinational enterprises international political economy multinational management and culture. These dimensions provide managers with tools and concepts needed for growing beyond national borders. Week 6: Innovation Contexts for innovation vary based on location industry and country. We look here at how innovation diffuses or spreads and thus how current technology such as the web and social media might affect the adoption of innovative outputs. It is essential that managers understand the contexts for innovation at the firm industry and country levels in creating and managing innovation strategies. Week 7: Finance Finance is the study of how investors allocate their assets over time under conditions of certainty and uncertainty and typically examines the relationship between money time and risk.

Este curso gratuito de cinco semanas está orientado a todos los que hablan español que desean mejorar sus competencias en la toma de decisiones estratégicas en el panorama empresarial y establecer simultáneamente redes con hispano parlantes alrededor de todo el mundo. Los estudiantes desarrollarán un proyecto trabajando en equipo a distancia y habrá retroalimentación entre los diferentes grupos. Enseña como construir un flujo de caja y como calcular su valor actualizado neto (VAN) y otros indicadores de su rentabilidad. Cubre temas conceptuales como los costos y beneficios pertinentes. También aspectos prácticos como el tratamiento de la depreciación la estimación del capital de trabajo y la determinación del horizonte de evaluación y del valor residual. Y cubre asuntos más técnicos como el cálculo de la tasa con la que se deben descontar los flujos o costo del capital. Se explica como incorporar en la evaluación los aspectos estratégicos del proyecto. Enseña como valorizar su ventaja competitiva y como incorporar las fuerzas que atentan contra la sustentación de las rentabilidades en el tiempo: la imitación la sustitución y otras. Y explica como valorizar la flexibilidad inherente al proyecto de ampliarse si se reciben buenas noticias y de reducirse en caso contrario. El curso muestra también como hacer uso de la información disponible en la industria en los estados financieros y en los precios de mercado. Respecto a estos precios se explica por ejemplo el método de valorización por múltiplos. Este permite definir un rango para el valor del proyecto directamente a partir de información del mercado financiero de precios de acciones de empresas comparables cuando estas empresas existen. El curso resalta las mejores prácticas en la construcción de los flujos de cajas en la incorporación de la estrategia y en la recolección de la información. Por ejemplo a la hora de definir un proyecto se recomienda no combinar decisiones separables y no separar proyectos complementarios o competitivos. El curso hace amplio uso de casos para introducir las materias en forma realista y estimulante.

The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student interaction tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom teaching activities such as whole class discussions jigsaws and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in back-and-forth dialog. This short course looks closely at student-to-student conversations and addresses ways to improve students'' abilities to engage in the types of interactions described in the new standards. This course consists of four sessions with three weeks between each session in order to provide extra time for application and reflection. The learning in this course relies heavily on participant contributions and comments. The sessions and assignments are designed for participants who teach or have access to classrooms in which they can gather samples of students’ conversation during lessons. Finally we include resources and tasks for instructional coaches and others who support teachers and build school-wide capacity. Please note that this is a slightly modified version of a previous course offered in Fall 2013. This course is targeted towards secondary school teachers. We hope you will join us on this exciting journey.

Weeks 3-4: Teaching the Constructive Conversation Skills These two weeks focus on instruction to support rich interaction introduced in Module 1. We analyze video clips that show teaching that fosters interaction skills described in the new standards.

The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student interaction tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom teaching activities such as whole class discussions jigsaws and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in back-and-forth dialog. This short course looks closely at student-to-student conversations and addresses ways to improve students'' abilities to engage in the types of interactions described in the new standards. This course consists of four sessions with three weeks between each session in order to provide extra time for application and reflection. The learning in this course relies heavily on participant contributions and comments. The sessions and assignments are designed for participants who teach or have access to classrooms in which they can gather samples of students’ conversation during lessons. Finally we include resources and tasks for instructional coaches and others who support teachers and build school-wide capacity. Please note that this is a slightly modified version of a previous course offered in Fall 2013. This course is targeted towards elementary school teachers. We hope you will join us on this exciting journey.

The amount and types of information created shared and critiqued every day is growing exponentially and many skills required in today’s working environment are not taught in formal school systems. In this more complex and highly-connected world we need new training and competency development—we need to design a new learning environment. The ultimate goal of this project-based course is to promote systematic design thinking that will cause a paradigm shift in the learning environments of today and tomorrow. Participants are not required to have computer programming skills but must have 1) a commitment to working in a virtual team and 2) the motivation to help people learn better. All of us have been involved in the learning process at some point in our lives; in this course we invite educators school leaders researchers students parents entrepreneurs computer programmers illustrators interface designers and all those who are interested in working together to create a new learning environment. After the completion of this course students will be able to: - Identify advantages disadvantages limitations and potentials of at least 10 interactive learning models and solutions. - Describe how online communication collaboration and visualization technology play a role in the behavioral cognitive constructivist and social dimensions of learning. - Describe the major components and processes involved in development of interactive education systems. - Communicate rationales of learning technology design approaches through team-oriented collaborations. - Evaluate the value of ideas principles and techniques used in educational media or systems. As a Final Team Project students will design a new learning model catering to 21st century environments and learners. Each self-formed team will design and develop an application or system that combines team interaction activities and learning support features in ways that are effective and appropriate for today''s computing and communication devices. Students must consider potential idiosyncrasies with various learning devices (e.g. tablet phone PC) infrastructure requirements (e.g. cellular network wi-fi Bluetooth) and any special hypothetical circumstances if relevant. In addition each team must create and defend a business model (non-profit for-profit or hybrid) for the launch and scale up their solution. Additional consideration will be given to teams that come up with system feature ideas presenting meaningful learning interaction and performance analytics.

These are three topics that build on the same mathematical background and that have several important connections: for example it is possible to find graph clusters via random walks and it is possible to use the linear programming approach to graph partitioning as a way to study random walks. We will study spectral graph theory which explains how certain combinatorial properties of graphs are related to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix and we will use it describe and analyze spectral algorithms for graph partitioning and clustering. Spectral graph theory will recur as an important tool in the rest of the course. We we will also discuss other approaches to graph partitioning via linear programming and semidefinite programming. Then we will study constructions of expander graphs which are graphs with very strong pseudorandomness properties which are useful in many applications including in cryptography in complexity theory in algorithms and data structures and in coding theory. Finally we will study the mixing time of random walks a problem that comes up in several applications including the analysis of the convergence time of certain randomized algorithms such as the Metropolis algorithm.

At Stanford’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design - known as the d.school - students of all disciplines learn the design thinking process as a methodology for creative and human-centered problem solving that empowers them to collaborate across disciplines and tackle the world’s biggest challenges. In this experiential course - free and open to all - you will learn the design thinking process by tackling a real world innovation challenge. As preparation for each stage of the challenge you will explore the main design thinking concepts through short videos each paired with brief activities to practice relevant methods and approaches. There will be one weekly assignment reporting on your progress as well as weekly Google hangouts with the instructor. On the last week of the course you will apply the process to your own context and challenges while hearing from experts who use design thinking to innovate in differents fields such as healthcare and education. By the end of the course you will have learned through experience the mindsets and basic tools for each stage of the design thinking process: Empathize: understanding the needs of those you are designing for.  Define: framing problems as opportunities for creative solutions. Ideate: generating a range of possible solutions.  Prototype: communicating the core elements of solutions to others. Test: learning what works and doesn’t work to improve solutions. While you will work on the course challenge as an individual you will interact with other like-minded participants from around the world to share your experiences and exchange feedback along the way. Developing self-reflection habits and the ability for effective peer-to-peer interactions are also important learning outcomes of the course. Please join our learning community! This online course was developed as part of Epicenter’s efforts to infuse entrepreneurship and innovation into undergraduate engineering education.

The new standards specifically describe the importance of students understanding the reasoning of others and engaging in meaningful conversations using evidence for claims. Yet this type of student-to-student discourse tends to be rare in classrooms. Common classroom activities such as whole class discussions jigsaws and think-pair-shares can have the appearance of constructive interactions but they often do not provide adequate opportunities for all students to engage in academically rich back-and-forth dialogs. This short course looks closely at student-to-student discourse and addresses how to facilitate student engagement in the types of interactions required by the new standards. It organizes a massive collaboration of educators who wish to support students particularly English Language Learners to co-create and build upon each other’s ideas as they interact with the content. Starting with the notion that in order to improve the quality of student discourse educators need to listen closely to existing talk the course asks participants to gather analyze and share examples of student conversations from their classrooms. The overall goal is for participating educators to better understand student-student classroom discourse and use what they learn to facilitate higher quality interactions that build disciplinary knowledge and skills. The four main objectives of this course are for participants to: Develop a practical understanding of academically-engaged classroom discourse with emphasis on what this looks like in linguistically diverse classrooms that are focused on teaching Common Core State Standards; Listen more carefully to student talk and use a discourse analysis tool to analyze student discourse focusing on how interactions build disciplinary language knowledge and skills. Learn and practice practical teaching strategies for building students’ abilities to engage in constructive face-to-face interactions; Collaborate with other educators and build professional relationships that result in an online community focused on improving students’ abilities to engage rich academic discourse across disciplines and grade levels.

Frequently Asked Questions Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment This course may be taken for a free statement of accomplishment. How much of the time commitment will this course be Online work will take around 1 hour per week; assignments will take around 1 hour per week. Any additional textbooks or software required No. Syllabus Weeks 1-2: Constructive Conversations I In these two weeks we dive into what high-quality talk between students can sound like in lessons that effectively teach the new standards. Specifically we focus on the features of “constructive interactions” during which students create clarify support and negotiate ideas as they talk about concepts and build understandings in a discipline. Weeks 3-4: Teaching the Constructive Conversation Skills These two weeks focus on instruction to support rich interaction introduced in Module 1. We analyze video clips that show teaching that fosters interaction skills described in the new standards. We look at activities that help students build interactions skills for staying focused on objectives building and negotiating ideas and clarifying ideas. Weeks 5-6: Constructive Conversations II These two weeks we will look more in depth at how to foster student interactions that build the learning of lesson objectives challenge thinking and push students to use more complex language of the Common Core standards. Week 7: Collaboration Communication and Community This will be a summative week when we will pull together everything we’ve covered in the course to create a product that communicates to other teachers the value of having a discourse focus for implementing the new standards. You will also consider next steps for applying and collaborating in this work during the year.','https://novoed.com/common-core','https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_vw7Ne-tGw?vq=auto&rel=0&showinfo=0&autohide=1&wmode=transparent&origin=https://novoed.com','2013-10-21','49','https://d2d6mu5qcvgbk5.cloudfront.net/courses/cover_photos/d92dd4caaf5ecb485bccbd54f70f84f6913ab87c.jpg?1379106613','','NovoEd','0','English','Yes','Stanford University Online','2014-04-10')

These lessons will develop your understanding of common numbers often found in the news on advertisements and online. You will see how numbers play important roles in arguments you hear about daily like issues such as gun control smoking pollution and heart attacks. And by the end of this course you’ll be able to use numbers to communicate your ideas. The format of this course is probably not like other math courses you’ve taken. Instead the Quantway® course was developed using principles that have been shown in research studies to be important in better developing students’ understanding of the material. One of these key principles is Productive Struggle. In short this means that to learn something you must try it out AND stick with it even when it gets challenging! The goal of the Quantway® is to help you learn things that you can actually use in life--not so you can memorize it for a test and then forget it. In fact by the end of this course you’ll be able to create a final project that uses numbers to prove a point to anyone who sees it. Given the large number of students enrolled in this class that’s a lot of people! We are all learning together and helping each other along the way. Check out course highlights » More Information Schedule This course takes 5 weeks. Each week you will watch a new video and do a new assignment. Workload You can expect to spend 3-5 hours a week on this course. Most of your time will be spent doing assignments Prerequisites A willingness to learn math in a new way.','https://novoed.com/numbers-life-quantway','https://www.youtube.com/embed/R3DpLx8grJw?vq=auto&rel=0&showinfo=0&autohide=1&wmode=transparent&origin=https://novoed.com','2013-10-21','34','https://d2d6mu5qcvgbk5.cloudfront.net/courses/cover_photos/3860e658e2d23610ecccdf293b7051f9057ab2b5.JPG?1380118683','','NovoEd','0','English','No','Numbers for Life''s Logo','2014-04-10')

You want a new way of connecting with people (great for networking!) You’re interviewing for jobs and want a strong way of presenting yourself You want to change your communication style You just want to have fun! Course Description: Acumen and The Ariel Group have created a hands-on course to help you develop your practical skills as a storyteller. Whether you work in an office making presentations in the boardroom as a teacher with 30 to 300 students interacting with customers or one-on-one with individuals using the elements of story bring you closer to your audience. Using stories makes your messages memorable gives your audience something to relate to and above all captures their attention motivating and inspiring them in new ways. A story taps into more than one element of communicating. Great storytellers are great communicators and effective leaders. Acumen believes that storytelling is an essential tool for changing the way the world tackles poverty because it starts with changing conversations around what we see hear feel and know to be true. Change leaders see the world’s potential and tell powerful stories that inspire action. Key Learning Outcomes: By the end of this course participants will: Be confident in using stories especially personal stories as part of their communication toolkit. Know how to tell stories and use a specific set of storytelling skills so that they connect with the hearts and minds of their audiences (an audience of one or many). Have developed rehearsed and received feedback on one personal story as a replicable model so that they can build a personal “library” or “back pocket” of stories that can be used in different situations. Be able to use a 5-step process to integrate story into presentations for change work or many other situations. Course Logistics: You will be expected to form a Story Team as part of this course. Join the course with a team in mind or find a team through the platform after the course starts (we will provide more instructions on how to do this in Week 1). All of your team members must be registered to this course through this platform to receive materials. We highly recommend forming a team with people you can meet with in person. If you have a strong internet connection you could “meet” online as well. Story Team meetings are an important and fun part of the course. This is where you will discuss the material practice with a friendly audience and learn from each other. This course will consist of a mix of team and individual assignments. The course materials are all provided online and Google Hangout ‘office hours’ will be scheduled twice throughout the course. Check out course highlights » More Information Workload: 1hr/week individually 2hr/week for your Story Team meetings (may vary depending on the size your team) Technical Requirements: You will need a computer that allows you to watch the video lectures and provides the ability to upload all 5 of your assignments.

You will learn the process technology entrepreneurs use to start companies. It involves taking a technology idea and finding a high-potential commercial opportunity gathering resources such as talent and capital figuring out how to sell and market the idea and managing rapid growth. To gain practical experience alongside the theory students form teams and work on startup projects in those teams. This is the second offering of the class. Last time nearly 40000 students from around the world participated and worked in teams together. The top teams were matched with Silicon Valley mentors and the best teams at the end of the class pitched their ideas to investors. Many of the alumni of the last class are continuing to build their startups and will be mentoring teams this time. By the conclusion of the course it is our hope that you understand how to: 1. Articulate a process for taking a technology idea and finding a high-potential commercial opportunity (high performing students will be able to discuss the pros and cons of alternative theoretical models). 2. Create and verify a plan for gathering resources such as talent and capital. 3. Create and verify a business model for how to sell and market an entrepreneurial idea. 4. Generalize this process to an entrepreneurial mindset of turning problems into opportunities that can be used in larger companies and other settings.

Course activities include evaluating sample...','The Course Given their emphasis on complex and sophisticated disciplinary skills and understandings the Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards require ways of assessing that go beyond routine multiple-choice tests. Whether students are learning to select use and explain evidence to support a claim or to analyze data to evaluate a hypothesis tests that require that students only bubble in a scantron are inadequate to measure (or support) students’ learning and growth. Performance assessments are more suited to this task. Performance-based tasks require that students create and produce rather than recall and regurgitate. While performance assessments vary along multiple dimensions including duration and focus they all demand that students use and apply critical skills and knowledge to demonstrate understanding. This nine-week course will focus on building educators’ capacity to use develop and implement curriculum-embedded performance assessments that fit local contexts. Course activities include evaluating sample performance tasks and developing and implementing a performance task that is aligned with a specific curricular unit and performance outcomes. We will use a learning-centered approach where assessments are not only about measuring learning but are also events for learning. This MOOC is designed for grade 6-12 teachers working in the core disciplines of mathematics language arts history/social studies and science. It is recommended that participants currently teach or have access to a classroom for which they can design a performance assessment and then implement that assessment. Participants will work collaboratively with other educators in their discipline to accomplish course learning goals and assignments. The four main objectives of this course are for participants to: Understand and identify features of high quality performance assessments; Develop a grade-level course-specific practical performance task that is aligned with (and embedded within) a curricular unit of study; Begin to use data from performance tasks to tailor and improve instruction and curriculum; Contribute to building an online community of educators focused on using performance-based assessments to identify and develop students’ abilities.','https://novoed.com/learning-design-common-core','','2014-09-08','0','https://d2d6mu5qcvgbk5.cloudfront.net/courses/cover_photos/7b0e7a02e5b1f8d9e7307e1473fdc8b5e83036c8.png?1385604321','','NovoEd','0','English','No','Stanford University Online','2014-04-10')
